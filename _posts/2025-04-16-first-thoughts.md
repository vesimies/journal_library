## 📝 Headline  
Starting the Journal — Finally!

---

## 🔍 What did I do today?  
Today I started this journal that I’ve been planning for a while now. I kept thinking I needed to learn more before starting — and to be honest, I’m still not quite there.  
But the whole point of this journal is to write about the process of learning and the journey toward my goals — not just the final destination.  
It feels a bit scary to put my thoughts out into the universe, but I’ve got to start somewhere. So here we go.

## 📚 What did I learn?  
I used Jekyll on GitHub Pages to set up this site, with a lot of help from ChatGPT, since I’m not a front-end developer. Jekyll makes it easier to get going without needing to build everything from scratch.  
I also learned that it’s totally possible to get things done even if you don’t fully know how at the start. That hesitation — waiting until you feel “ready” — is something I’m working on letting go of.

## 💭 Reflections & thoughts  
I want to use this journal to get more comfortable using technical language. I usually understand the terms when I read them, but unless I actively use them in speaking or writing, they don’t stick.  
Writing will help me build that fluency, and reviewing my daily work should also help me learn more effectively.  
The site isn’t perfect yet, but that’s okay — the most important thing is that I’ve started.

## ✅ Next steps / To-do  
- Improve the look and layout of the site  
- Write regularly to build consistency  
- Keep reminding myself: it’s okay to figure things out along the way
