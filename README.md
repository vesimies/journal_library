# Learning Journal & Source Library ðŸ““

This is a personal project where I document my daily learning journey.

## Why Iâ€™m Doing This

I created this journal to:

- Reflect on what Iâ€™ve been learning day to day  
- Practice writing and expressing thoughts clearly  
- Get more familiar with technical language and terminology  
- Process and internalize new information more effectively  

Writing things down helps me remember and understand better.
This project is also a way for me to build a regular habit of learning and documenting.

## Structure

Each entry is organized by date. I plan to include:

- A brief summary of what I studied  
- Notes, thoughts, and reflections  
- Links to useful resources  
- Occasional code snippets or examples, if relevant  

## Future Plans

As the project grows, I might:

- Tag entries by topic (e.g. SQL, Python, Git)
- Add a table of contents or index  
- Turn this journal into a small static website using GitHub Pages  
- Eventually evolve it into a full portfolio site as I create more projects  
  - At first, this will be a journal site  
  - Over time, Iâ€™ll start including other projects  
  - The journal and portfolio will eventually be combined into one site

## How to Use This

Feel free to browse the entries if you're curious. Maybe this can inspire your own learning journal too.
